# Introduction_to_Python
This is the beginning of my journey into Python and Programming, this is a record of my Programming assignments as part of my APPLIED DATA SCIENCE DEGREE APPRENTICESHIP BSC (HONS). Feel free to take a look and use the files, more than happy to share and help people on their own journey.

### Assignment One ###

*Task 1: As an individual, write a report discussing the following:*

 - The use of variables in Java, Python, and C#. You will need to explain in your own words the different types and give some examples of how they are used in each language.
 - The use of conditional statements in Java, Python, and C#. You will need to explain in your own words the different types and give some examples of how they are used in each language.
 - In your own words which programming language out of the three (C#, Java, and Python) do you feel is growing and has the best employment opportunities and why?
 
1500 words (30% of assignment)

*Task 2: As an individual, write a set of programs that will incorporate the following:*

 - A program that includes a selection of a variable type from a user, the use of IF statements and include at least one nested IF that will output the definition and usage of the selected variable type. You are to research the variable definitions and paraphrase them into your own wording.
 - A program that will carry out several forms of calculations based on user inputs and include IF statements that incorporate the ‘AND’ (or ‘OR’) operator.
 
You will be marked on the efficiency as well as the complexity of your code, so plan the program well to incorporate more than just the basics but without losing efficiency.
You will also be marked on code structure, variable types and your understanding of what they are, naming conventions and comments.
